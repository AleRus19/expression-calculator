# Expression Calculator

A simple command-line calculator that evaluates mathematical expressions. It is based on the shunting yard algorithm: expressions are transformed from infix to postfix notation and then evaluated.

## Features

- Supports basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, exponentiation
- Handles parentheses for grouping
- Simple and easy to use

## Usage
For evaluating expression:

```bash
dotnet run eval --e "2 ^ (3 + 1) / 2"
```

**Example Output:**
```
Result: 8
```

To convert an infix expression to RPN (Reverse Polish Notation):

```bash
dotnet run rpn --e "2 ^ (3 + 1) / 2"
```

**Example Output:**
```
231+^2/
